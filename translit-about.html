<h1>About Sanskrit transliteration</h1>

<p>Sanskrit is usually written in the Devanagari script. (By some accounts,
this convention is only a recent phenomenon, dating back to the late 19th
century when the British undertook the printing of a large number of Sanskrit
documents in the Devanagari script; before then Sanskrit was written in
various scripts; for instance, all of Bhasa's works are known to us through
manuscripts written in the Malayalam script.)</p>

<p>For use in situations where using Devanagari is infeasible, various
schemes have been devised to represent Sanskrit letters in a script other
than Devanagari -- usually with English letters.</p>

<p>In <em>print</em>, the most common is probably the International Alphabet
of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST), which uses English letters with
diacritics. The need for Sanskrit transliteration in print came
because of either:
<ul>
  <li>People studying Sanskrit who did not know the Devanagari script.</li>
  <li>Printers who did not have a Sanskrit font, or found typesetting Sanskrit harder (which it is)</li>
</ul>
For these purposes, it is understandable how a system with diacritics
came about.  The IAST has both uppercase and lowercase letters; entire
books were supposed to be written in IAST after all.</p>

<p>On the internet, however, the need for a system of Sanskrit
transliteration arises because people do not have an easy way of
inputting, or of even viewing, characters outside the normal range of
the letters in the English alphabet.  The transliteration in this is
case is not so much something to be read directly, as it is an
"encoding", a way of expressing Sanskrit words when Sanskrit fonts are
not available.  In this setting, a system with diacritics is not much
help. It is as hard to input many of the IAST characters as it is to
input Devanagari characters directly. Thus, the commonly used schemes
are ASCII schemes that use only the "normal" letters, employing case
to specify the correct letter.</p>

Issues remain:

<ul>
<li> One is the question of what ligatures/glyphs you want. (See
  pictures.)  Fortunately, this is not my problem. This is the web,
  not print. All those glyphs are represented by the same Unicode
  characters (which is what I give you), and the way the conjuncts are
  rendered is entirely up to your end.</li>

<li> Another is the question of what happens when (say) "[a][i]" occurs. The
  English "ai" would produce "[ai]". Similarly when the consonants "k"
  and "h" occur together but what is intended is not the consonant
  "kh". So: if you want to specify this, you must delimit them
  somehow.  I have decided that "a{}i", "k{}h" (etc.) be usd in these
  cases, although they surely arise rarely.</li>

<li>There are other characters (Chandrabindu, Avagraha, Virama) which
  might occur frequently in Sanskrit, and other forms of letters
  (consonants with a dot below them, the La letter, etc.) which might
  more often occur when transcribing words from other languages in
  Devanagari. I do not think it worthwhile to devise appropriate
  letters that would fit into the various transliteration schemes,
  please use the character picker when one of these arise.</li>

<li>What if you want English text that you don't want converted? Put it
  inside angular brackets thus:
  saH rAmaH <He is Rama> sA sItA <She is Sita>
  becomes
  ...

  [Footnote: When I say angular brackets, I actually mean the less
  than and greater than characters on your keyboard.  They are not
  actually angular brackets: angular brackets are something else: ]</li>

</ul>
