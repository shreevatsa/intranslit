<h1>Documentation</h1>

<h2>What we want</h2>
Let me use ITRANS-to-Devanagari as an example.

In the spirt of Test-Driven Development (although this is being written
after the code :P), here are a few tests:
<ul>
  <li>When the user types 'k', we need to see the string '&ka;&hal;',
  which is Unicode two characters: &ka;+&hal;</li>
  <li>When the user types 'ka', we need to see the string '&ka;', which is
  one Unicode character.</li>
  <li>When the user types 'kai', we need to see  the string '&ka;&ai;', which
  is two characters: '&ka;'+'&ai;'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
Javascript's canonical data structure -- called <tt>Object</tt> -- is an associative array (also known as hash table, map, etc.), so we use it.

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>It parses the whole string each time you type a letter. I expect that
  it will be used only for transliterating short pieces of text (at a time),
  so I do not view this as an urgent issue.</li>
<li>It converts all CONSONANT+VIRAMA+VOWEL occurrences to CONSONANT+VOWEL.</li>
<li>If you type "kaa" into Harvard-Kyoto you get [ka]+[a], but it is transliterated into ITRANS as "kaa" so if you then go to ITRANS and type something, the original Harvard-Kyoto changes to "kA" as well.</li>
</ul>
